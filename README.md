This website is my developer portfolio.

If you want to use this code for your own website, you can do it with attribution.
I value keeping my site open source, but plagiarism is bad. It is demoralizing to find that someone has copied my work without giving me credit. I spent a substantial amount of time and effort building, designing, and maintaining this website. I request you to do your part and be a responsible part of the open-source community. In contrast to seeing my code copied without attribution, imagine the happiness I'll feel being attributed and having my name on a website.
